First, you need to spin up an Amazon EC2 instance and save the pem file on your local machine. You can save it as test.pem
Then make sure that you have SSH server and SSH client option enabled under the Apps & Feature tab on Windows 10.

Open the Windows power shell and navigate to the directory where you kept your pem file. Execute the below command one by one
FYI: Rename the test.pem to your original pem file name.

$path = ".\test.pem"
Reset to remove explicit permissions
icacls.exe $path /reset
Give current user explicit read-permission
icacls.exe $path /GRANT:R "$($env:USERNAME):(R)"
Disable inheritance and remove inherited permissions
icacls.exe $path /inheritance:r

Note: If you don't execute the above command you'll get the below errors : 
 Windows SSH: Permissions for 'private-key' are too open Set correct permissions
-- warning unprotected private key file windows 10
-- ssh error warning unprotected private key file
-- it is required that your private key files are not accessible by others. windows

Now copy the ssh command that you find inside the connect tab on Amazon EC2.

Open the command prompt and navigate to your pem file location. Execu the copied command and click enter.

That's it. You are successfully ssh into your EC2 instance
