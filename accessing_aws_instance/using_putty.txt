steps to follow to access a virtual machine instance using putty


step1: Download putty and puttygen.exe through browser 
step2: Now open the puttygen.exe and there you will see a button called load, you need to load the <key_pair>.pem file in the format <key_pair>.ppk 
step3: Now in the Hostname , first go to your instance in aws ,there you will see an option called connect . click on that and scroll down you will see something like this

ssh -i "ec2-demo.pem" ubuntu@ec2-35-154-224-78.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com

Note : here ec2-demo.pem is the name of the key-value pair which i have created for my instance 

copy the hostname i.e  ubuntu@ec2-35-154-224-78.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
and paste it there in the HostName.

Now in the puttygen console you will see an option for SSH , click on the + then go to Auth there you will get a box asking for the private key for your instance created. Browse and get there .ppk (generated in the folder where .pem file)


Now again go to the session in the puttygen console and you can save your session there and then click on Open

Congrats !! you have entered to the VM on the cloud  Yay!!
